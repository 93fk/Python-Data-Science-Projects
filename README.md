**Project inspired by novel method for multivariate time series classification method.**

In the heart of this method, there is a clever aproximation of Fourier coefficients of time series, then a careful selection of best coeficients by statistical methods.

**Topics**: Fourier Transform, Statistical Tests, Entropy, pipelines, visualization, classification
