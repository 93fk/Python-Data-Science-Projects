**Intro to sklearn.pipeline utilities.**

Project built upon kaggle dataset regarding movies. The kernel includes Exploratory Data Analysis, Feature Engineering and a nuber of predictive models.

**Topics** : EDA, pipelines, classification, visualization, Grid Search, Linear Models, Ensemble Models

**Project inspired by novel method for multivariate time series classification method.**

In the heart of this method, there is a clever aproximation of Fourier coefficients of time series, then a careful selection of best coeficients by statistical methods.

**Topics**: Fourier Transform, Statistical Tests, Entropy, pipelines, visualization, classification

**Setting a challenge to popular QWERTY layout.**

The intention is to find a layout suitable for fast touch typing. It's achieved by parsing multiple books scraped from the web.

**Topics**: Web Scraping, visualization, graphs, text processing
